# Assets Directory

This directory contains placeholder files for the React Portfolio app.

**Note:** Large image and PDF files have been removed from git tracking to keep the repository size under GitHub's limits.

## Files that were removed:
- Resume PDFs
- Large images (PNG, JPG, WEBP files)
- Icons and logos

## To restore these files locally:
1. Copy your original assets back to this directory
2. The files will work locally but won't be tracked by git
3. For production deployment, consider using a CDN or image hosting service

## Alternative solutions:
- Use image hosting services like Cloudinary, Imgur, or AWS S3
- Compress images to reduce file sizes
- Use web-optimized formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Host large files on a separate service and reference them via URLs
